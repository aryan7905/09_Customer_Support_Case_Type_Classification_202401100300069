# 🎯 Customer Support Case Type Classification

A machine learning solution that automatically classifies customer support cases into billing, technical, or general queries.

## 📋 Overview

This project provides a streamlined text classification system built in Python using Google Colab. It takes customer support messages and categorizes them to help customer service teams prioritize and route inquiries more efficiently.

## ✨ Features

- 🤖 Automatic classification of support tickets into three categories:
  - 💰 Billing issues
  - 🔧 Technical problems
  - ❓ General inquiries
- 🧹 Text preprocessing to clean and standardize customer messages
- 🧠 Model training with two different algorithms (Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression)
- 📊 Performance evaluation with detailed metrics
- 📈 Visualization of results with confusion matrix
- 🔍 Feature importance analysis to understand classification decisions
- 🚀 Ready-to-use function for classifying new support cases

## 🔧 Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## 💻 Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/aryan7905/09_Customer_Support_Case_Type_Classification_202401100300069.git
cd 09_Customer_Support_Case_Type_Classification_202401100300069
```

2. Upload the notebook to Google Colab or run it locally

3. Ensure your dataset is in the correct location (`/content/support_cases.csv` for Colab)

## 📚 Dataset

The model expects a CSV file with at least two columns:
- A text column containing the customer support messages
- A category column with labels (billing, technical, general)

Example format:
```
case_type,category
"I was charged twice this month",billing
"The app keeps crashing when I open it",technical
"How do I change my email address?",general
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Quick Start

1. Run the notebook cells sequentially in Google Colab
2. Modify the `text_column` and `target_column` variables in Cell 2 to match your dataset's column names
3. Use the `classify_support_case()` function from Cell 5 to classify new support cases

### Classification Function

```python
result = classify_support_case("The application is not responding when I click submit")
print(f"Category: {result['category']}")
print(f"Confidence: {result['confidence']}")
```

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing:** 🧹 Cleans text by removing special characters, converting to lowercase, and normalizing spaces
2. **Feature Extraction:** 📝 Transforms text into TF-IDF feature vectors
3. **Model Training:** 🏋️‍♀️ Trains classification models on the processed data
4. **Evaluation:** ✅ Compares model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
5. **Feature Analysis:** 🔍 Identifies the most important words for each category
6. **Classification:** 🎯 Uses the best model to predict categories for new support cases

## 📊 Results

The models typically achieve accuracy between 80-95% depending on the dataset quality and class distribution. Logistic Regression usually outperforms Naive Bayes for this task.

## 🔧 Customization

- Adjust the `max_features` parameter in the TF-IDF vectorizer to include more or fewer words
- Try different classification algorithms by importing from scikit-learn
- Add more preprocessing steps like stemming or lemmatization for potentially better results
